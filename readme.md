## Reflection
Overall, the game was simple to implement. It was very fun getting to build a game of hangman that anyone could enjoy! The biggest challenge of the project was not actually the coding aspect, but the coordinating of the team. Finding time that everyone could meet was difficult. All three of us have different schedules for school and also working hours. Finding time to coordinate everyone's efforts into multiple meetings that required a full schedule alignment proved to be difficult. We found it best to utilize an async approach. Allowing us to communicate on an as needed basis, creating pull requests as work was completed. Utilizing GitHub to its full potential proved to be one of the biggest learning experiences and helpful tools during this project. GitHub is an extremely common tool in industry, making it more commonplace in a students academic journey is incredibly important as most computer science students will encounter it in their career. 

Our team had a variety of expertise in programming languages, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS gave us a common denominator that we all enjoyed. allowing us to either use a language comfortable to us or return to an familiar favorite. We did not run into any major occurrences of our code not working or large roadblocks that hindered steady and consistent progress.

We began the project by working on a wireframe together. We used one of the provided class times to create a wireframe of the hangman project and the desired states such as win and lose. We then turned the wireframes into a high fidelity wireframe. This gave us direction for color, the hangman icon and the overall desire on how to handle clicks, should it be an on screen keyboard or listen for physical keyboard strokes. From there we created the base project, ensuring functionality was there, with the ability to upgrade the game later if we desired. Once we had the game fully functioning and giving user feedback, we added some more design elements to bring the game above and beyond! 

In hindsight, this hangman project was more than just coding a game; it was about learning to work collaboratively in a real-world scenario. The challenges we faced and the solutions we crafted together reinforced the value of teamwork, clear communication, and the essential soft skills that are just as vital as technical expertise. As we wrap up this project and reflect, we can confidently say that not only did we create a fun game, but we also grew as professionals, gaining invaluable insights that will benefit us in our future endeavors.
